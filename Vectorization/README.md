<h1>Vectorization</h1>

# Bag of Words<br>
-Bag of Words (BoW) is a common technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis to represent textual data. The basic idea behind BoW is to convert a piece of text into a numerical vector by counting the frequency of each word in the text and representing it as a vector of word counts.
## Representing words by their frequencies

<ol>
    <li>
        # Sentence 1: This hot dog is tasty -> hot, dog, tasty
    </li>
    <li>
        # Sentence 2: This dog is so cute -> dog, cute
    </li>
    <li>
        # Sentence 3: The food is felicious -> food, delicious
    </li>
    <li>
        # Sentence 3: The food is weird -> food, weird
    </li>
</ol>

# Example
    
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
string = ["This is an example of bag of words."]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
x = vectorizer.fit_transform(string)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(x.toarray())
```
    
```python
words_and_vectors = [(list(x.toarray())[0][i],vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i])
for i in range(len(list(x.toarray()[0])))]

for i in words_and_vectors:
  print(i)
    
```
    
# Tf-idf Vectorizer<br>
-tf: How frequently a term occurs in a document<br>
TF(t) = (Number of items term t appears in a document)/(Total number of terms in the document)<br>
## Example: <br>
1- "Data science plays a crucial role in extracting insights from large datasets."<br>
TF("data") = 1/12<br>
TF("science") = 1/12<br>
TF("plays") = 1/12<br>
TF("crucial") = 1/12<br>
TF("role") = 1/12<br>
TF("extracting") = 1/12<br>
TF("insights") = 1/12<br>
TF("from") = 1/12<br>
TF("large") = 1/12<br>
TF("datasets") = 1/12<br>
<br>
-idf: the weight of rare words. The words that occur rarerly in the corpus have a high IDF score.<br>
IDF(t) = log(Total number of documents)/(Number of documents with term t in it)<br>
## Example:<br>
1-  "Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data."<br>
2-  "The application of artificial intelligence is growing rapidly."<br>
3- "data scientists use statistical methods to draw meaningful insights."<br>
IDF(Machine) = log 3/1<br>
IDF(data) = log 3/2<br>
...<br>
## Tf-idf = Tf * idf<br>
# Example:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()
doc1 = "data scientists use statistical methods to draw meaningful insights."
doc2 = "machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data."
